  <p>
    NodeCHS is a node.js user group based in Charleston, SC. Anyone is welcome to come, and the focus is on informal learning and sharing. Come learn to code, show off your latest javascript project, or just to chat general code. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We are very beginner friendly, so all you need to bring is a laptop and some curiosity (and you can even skip the laptop if you want; we have extras).

  <p id='hacknight'>
    We currently hold a weekly hacknight on Tuesdays at 7pm in Avondale. Come on out, meet some fellow hackers, and learn some code. Right now we are working on things like audio, maps, games, and robots.
